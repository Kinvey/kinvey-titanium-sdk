# Kinvey Titanium SDK
[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

This node and bower module makes it very easy to connect your Titanium app with Kinvey.

## How to use

#### 1. Sign up for Kinvey
To use the SDK, sign up for Kinvey if you have not already done so. Go to the [sign up](https://console.kinvey.com/#signup) page, and follow the steps provided.

#### 2. Install the SDK
Download the sdk by visiting the [Titanium Downloads Page](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/titanium-v3.0/downloads) and add it to your project. Preferably, put it in a directoy named `app/lib`. Make sure the `lib` directory is located inside your `app` directory otherwise you might receive an error that the Kinvey SDK is not build for arm64.

#### 3. Configure the SDK
If you are using the Alloy framework, add the snippet below to `app/alloy.js`. The SDK is now globally available under `Alloy.Globals.Kinvey`.

```javascript
var Kinvey = Alloy.Globals.Kinvey = require('kinvey-titanium-sdk');
```

If you are not using the Alloy framework, add the snippet below to `Resources/app.js`. The SDK is globally available under Kinvey.

```javascript
var Kinvey = require('kinvey-titanium-sdk');
```

Next, use `Kinvey.init` to configure your app. Replace `<appKey>` and `<appSecret>` with your apps app key and secret. You can find these for your app using the [Kinvey Console App](https://console.kinvey.com).

```javascript
Kinvey.init({
    appKey: '<appKey>',
    appSecret: '<appSecret>'
});
```

#### 4. Verify Set Up
You can use the following snippet to verify the app credentials were entered correctly. This function will contact the backend and verify that the SDK can communicate with your app.

```javascript
Kinvey.ping().then(function(response) {
  console.log('Kinvey Ping Success. Kinvey Service is alive, version: ' + response.version + ', response: ' + response.kinvey);
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.log('Kinvey Ping Failed. Response: ' + error.message);
});
```
